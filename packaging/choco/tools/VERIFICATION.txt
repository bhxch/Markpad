VERIFICATION

The Markpad executable in this Chocolatey package was built automatically from
source code using GitHub Actions.

Source Repository: https://github.com/alecdotdev/markpad

The build process produces `Markpad.exe` via `npm run tauri build`, which is
then copied directly into the `tools` folder of this package. The process is fully
automated. No pre-compiled binaries from external sources are included.
