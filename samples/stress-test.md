# 1. Basic Typography

This is a normal paragraph. It includes **bold text**, *italic text*, ***bold italic text***, ~~strikethrough text~~, `inline code`, and an escaped \*asterisk\*.

You can also test combinations such as **bold with `inline code`**, *italic with [a link](https://example.com)*, and ~~strikethrough with **bold text**~~.

Inserted text uses Pandoc's and CriticMarkup's spelling: ++this was added++, and it nests like the others — ++inserted with **bold**++.

A lone `+` or a pair with a space between them is ordinary text: 1 + 1, and a++ b ++c stays as written.

## Heading Level 2

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

###### Heading Level 6

A horizontal rule follows.

# 2. Paragraphs and Line Breaks

This paragraph is intentionally long enough to wrap across several lines in most readers. A good Markdown reader should preserve a comfortable line length, readable spacing, and consistent typography without making the text feel either cramped or excessively stretched. The visual distinction between headings, body text, links, inline code, and emphasis should remain clear even when a document contains many different formatting elements in close proximity.

This is a new paragraph created by a blank line.

This line ends with two spaces.  
This text should begin on a new rendered line without starting a new paragraph.

This line uses an HTML break.<br>
This text should also begin on a new line.

# 3. Lists

## Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
    - Third-level item
- Third item

Alternative markers:

* Asterisk item
* Another item

+ Plus item
+ Another item

## Ordered List

1. First step
2. Second step
   1. Nested step
   2. Another nested step
3. Third step

Numbers may all be written as `1.` in the source:

1. Alpha
1. Bravo
1. Charlie
1. Delta

## Mixed List

1. Prepare the test environment.
   - Install the Markdown reader.
   - Open this file.
   - Enable preview mode, if available.
2. Check navigation.
   - Use the outline or table of contents.
   - Jump between distant headings.
3. Check editing behavior.
   - Modify a paragraph.
   - Add a table row.
   - Save and reopen the file.

## Definition List Extension

Markdown
: A lightweight markup language.

Reader
: Software that renders Markdown into formatted text.

Editor
: Software that allows the source Markdown to be changed.

# 4. Links and Images

An inline link: [Example website](https://example.com)

A link with a title: [Example website](https://example.com "Example Domain")

An automatic URL: <https://example.com>

An automatic email link: <someone@example.com>

A reference-style link: [OpenAI][openai-reference]

[openai-reference]: https://openai.com "OpenAI"

An internal link back to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents).

## Image Syntax

The following remote image may or may not load depending on network access and reader security settings:

![Placeholder image](https://placehold.co/800x240?text=Markdown+Reader+Test "Remote placeholder")

A local-image reference is also included for syntax testing:

```markdown
![Local diagram](images/sample-diagram.png)
```

An image with a title, which most readers show on hover:

![Markpad in light mode](../pics/lightmode.png "Light mode")

A reference-style image, where the destination lives elsewhere in the document:

![Drag and drop][dnd-image]

[dnd-image]: ../pics/drag-and-drop.png "Dropping a file onto the editor"

## Wikilinks

Obsidian's spelling, rewritten before rendering:

- A heading in another document: [[markdown-syntax#3. Lists]]
- With an alias: [[markdown-syntax#3. Lists|see the lists chapter]]
- A heading in this document: [[#6. Tables]]
- An embed of a local image: `![[lightmode.png]]`

A wikilink with no heading is deliberately left as literal text, because `[[Notes]]` is also how citation numbering and reference links are written: [[Notes]].

## Block Ids

A paragraph can carry an id and be linked to from anywhere. ^stress-block

That paragraph ends with `^stress-block`, and [[#^stress-block]] points at it.

## Video and Audio

An image reference whose file is a video or a sound becomes a player. The files below do not exist in this repository — the point is that the *syntax* resolves to a player element rather than to a broken image:

![A screen recording](media/demo.mp4)

![An interview](media/episode.mp3)

Video extensions: `mp4`, `webm`, `ogg`, `mov`. Audio: `mp3`, `wav`, `aac`, `flac`, `m4a`.

## YouTube

A YouTube link alone in its paragraph becomes a thumbnail:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

The image form does the same:

![Any caption](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

A YouTube link in the middle of a sentence — like https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ here — stays an ordinary link, because replacing it would break the sentence around it.

# 5. Blockquotes

> This is a basic blockquote.
>
> It contains a second paragraph.

> **Note:** A reader should visually distinguish this content from normal body text.

Nested blockquotes:

> Level one
>
>> Level two
>>
>>> Level three

Blockquote containing a list:

> Recommended checks:
> - Typography
> - Spacing
> - Navigation
> - Search
> - Export

# 7. Code

Inline code looks like `print("Hello, Markdown")`.

## Python

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Iterable

@dataclass
class TestResult:
    name: str
    passed: bool
    details: str = ""

def summarize(results: Iterable[TestResult]) -> str:
    results = list(results)
    passed = sum(result.passed for result in results)
    total = len(results)
    return f"{passed}/{total} checks passed"

checks = [
    TestResult("Headings", True),
    TestResult("Tables", True),
    TestResult("Footnotes", False, "Extension not enabled"),
]

print(summarize(checks))
```

## JavaScript

```javascript
const features = [
  "headings",

const supported = features.filter(feature => feature !== "diagrams");
console.log(`Supported: ${supported.join(", ")}`);
```

    feature_name,
    supported,
    notes
FROM markdown_features
WHERE priority IN ('High', 'Medium')
ORDER BY priority, feature_name;
```

## Diff

```diff
- Old heading
+ Improved heading

- [ ] Incomplete task
+ [x] Completed task
```

# 8. Task Lists

- [x] Open the file
- [x] Check heading hierarchy
- [ ] Check table alignment
- [ ] Check syntax highlighting
- [ ] Check outline navigation
- [ ] Test export to HTML
- [ ] Test export to PDF

Nested task list:

- [ ] Reader evaluation
  - [x] Installation
  - [x] File association
  - [ ] Rendering
  - [ ] Editing
  - [ ] Export
  - [ ] Search

## Task List Shapes

Toggling a checkbox in the preview has to find the line to rewrite in the
source. Each shape below is a separate case for that lookup, and every one of
them is expected to toggle — and to toggle **only itself**.

Ordered, with a dot:

1. [ ] First ordered task
2. [x] Second ordered task
3. [ ] Third ordered task

Ordered, with a parenthesis:

1) [ ] Parenthesised marker
2) [x] Also a task

Other bullet characters:

* [ ] Asterisk marker
+ [x] Plus marker

Inside a quote:

> - [ ] A task in a blockquote
> - [x] A second one
> - [ ] A third

Deeply nested, mixing markers and depths:

- [ ] Level one
  - [x] Level two
    * [ ] Level three with an asterisk
      1. [ ] Level four, ordered
    * [x] Back to level three
  - [ ] Level two again

## Task Lists With No Blank Line Above Them

A list that begins immediately after prose is a different case for anything
that counts lines, because there is no blank line for a pattern to run past.
The next line is prose, and the list starts on the line after it with nothing
between them:
- [ ] Straight after the paragraph
- [x] Second in the run
- [ ] Third in the run

The same again, this time with a blank line above the list, which is how most
people write one:

- [ ] After a blank line
- [x] Second in the run
- [ ] Third in the run

## Adjacent Tasks

Nothing between these, so an off-by-one lands on a real task rather than on
nothing — which is the difference between a checkbox that looks dead and one
that silently ticks its neighbour. Toggle any single line and check that the
other five are untouched:

- [ ] Adjacent one
- [ ] Adjacent two
- [ ] Adjacent three
- [ ] Adjacent four
- [ ] Adjacent five
- [ ] Adjacent six

## A Task Carrying Continuation Lines

The shape from the file attached to #148. A task whose text is one line, followed
by a dozen indented lines that all belong to the same list item — mixed 4- and
8-space indents, every line an inline code span, and most ending in two trailing
spaces, which makes each one a hard break rather than a new paragraph. The whole
run is a single lazy-continuation paragraph inside the item.

Note also that the list starts immediately after the heading, with no blank line
between them.

### Essential
- [x] Repo management  
    `sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf`  
        `fastestmirror=True`  
        `max_parallel_downloads=10`  
        `defaultyes=True`  
    `sudo dnf install https://mirrors.example.org/free/release-$(rpm -E %dist).noarch.rpm -y`  
    `sudo dnf -y update`  
        `sudo dnf repolist --all | grep -i example`  
        `sudo dnf config-manager setopt example-free.enabled=1`  
    `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`  
- [x] Custom refresh rate  
    `kscreen-doctor output.1.addCustomMode.1920.1080.75000.reduced`

Two things this exercises that nothing else here does: a checkbox whose item is
many lines tall, so the control and its text can be laid out apart from one
another; and continuation lines holding `$(…)`, `|` and `%`, which several of
the preprocessing passes look for.

The one dimension this file cannot carry is line endings — it is LF throughout,
and the original was CRLF. That half is covered by
`scripts/taskToggleLineEndings.test.ts`, which drives both endings through the
real write-back.

## Task-Like Text That Is Not A Task

None of these should become a checkbox:

Some prose containing - [ ] in the middle of a sentence.

    - [ ] An indented code block, not a list

`- [ ] inline code`

```markdown
- [ ] A fenced code block
```

- Not a task, just a bullet whose text starts with a bracket \[x\]

# 9. Footnotes

This sentence contains a footnote reference.[^first]

A second reference can contain a longer explanation.[^long-note]

A named footnote can be reused.[^shared] Here it appears again.[^shared]

[^first]: This is the first footnote.

[^long-note]: This footnote contains multiple sentences. It is useful for testing spacing, backlink behavior, and the layout of longer notes. Some readers place footnotes at the end of the document, while others render them as popovers.

[^shared]: This footnote is referenced more than once.

# 10. Mathematics

Inline math extension:

$E = mc^2$

Block math extension:

$$
F = ma
$$

A longer expression:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Matrix syntax:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$

# 11. Mermaid Diagrams

Some readers render Mermaid diagrams; others show the source code.

Escaped characters:

\* not italic  
\_ not emphasis  
\# not a heading  
\[ not a link  
\` not code  
\\ backslash  

Characters inside inline code should remain literal: `* _ # [ ] ( ) < > &`.

# 15. Long-Form Reading Test

## Why Reader Design Matters

A Markdown reader appears simple because the source format is simple, but the reading experience depends on many small decisions. Typography, line length, spacing, contrast, heading hierarchy, code presentation, and navigation all influence how quickly a reader can understand a document. A technically correct renderer may still feel unpleasant if paragraphs stretch across an entire widescreen monitor, if code blocks have insufficient contrast, or if tables require excessive horizontal scrolling.

Good readers usually provide several layers of interaction. At the most basic level, they convert plain Markdown into formatted text. More capable applications add an outline, tabs, search, source and preview synchronization, theme controls, export functions, and support for extensions. The best option depends on whether the user primarily reads documentation, takes short notes, writes technical material, or maintains a large personal knowledge base.

## Source View Versus Preview View

Source view is valuable because Markdown remains readable even without rendering. Symbols such as hashes, asterisks, backticks, and hyphens communicate structure directly in the text. Preview view is useful because it removes syntax noise and presents the document as a polished page. Editors that offer a split view can provide both benefits at once, particularly when working with tables, code blocks, and links.

A synchronized split view should keep the source and preview aligned while scrolling. This sounds minor, but it becomes important in long documents. Without synchronization, users may repeatedly lose their position when switching between editing and reading. Outline navigation can solve part of the problem by showing headings in a sidebar and allowing direct jumps to major sections.

## Performance Considerations

Large Markdown files can reveal weaknesses that are invisible in short notes. Some editors re-render the entire document after every keystroke, which may create lag when the file contains hundreds of headings, tables, or diagrams. Others process only the changed section and remain responsive. Search speed, outline generation, and startup time also become more noticeable as the file grows.

Syntax highlighting adds another layer of work. A document containing dozens of fenced code blocks in different languages may require multiple parsers. Mermaid diagrams, mathematical notation, and embedded HTML can increase processing demands further. A reader that handles this test file smoothly is likely to perform well for ordinary documentation and note-taking.

## Portability

One of Markdown's strongest advantages is portability. A `.md` file is plain text and can be opened in almost any editor. The basic syntax is broadly compatible, but extensions are not universal. Tables and task lists are common, while footnotes, definition lists, mathematical expressions, admonitions, and Mermaid diagrams depend on the renderer.

For long-term notes, standard Markdown is the safest foundation. Extensions can still be useful, but it is worth checking how the source looks when an extension is unavailable. A Mermaid diagram, for example, remains visible as a code block even if it is not rendered. This graceful fallback is one reason Markdown works well across different tools.

# 16. Repeated Technical Notes

The sections below deliberately repeat a structured note format many times. This makes the file long enough to test outline navigation, scrolling performance, search, folding, and rendering consistency.

## Note 01: Document Structure

**Status:** In review  
**Owner:** Team 2  
**Priority:** Medium

Use headings consistently so readers can generate a reliable outline. Avoid skipping heading levels unless there is a clear structural reason. This numbered section is intentionally similar to the other sections, but the identifiers, status values, and examples vary. Repetition helps reveal whether a reader's outline remains usable when many headings have nearly identical names.

### Objectives

- Confirm that heading anchors remain unique.
- Check whether the outline shows the full heading text.
- Search for `Note 01` and verify that the correct section is selected.
- Collapse and expand this section, if folding is supported.

### Example Record

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record ID | MD-1001 |
| Revision | 2.1 |
| Category | Document Structure |
| Confidence | 71% |
| Review Cycle | 2 months |

### Observation

The rendering should remain consistent across the entire file. Heading size, paragraph spacing, table borders, inline-code styling, and list indentation should not drift between early and late sections. Long documents are especially useful for identifying memory leaks, delayed scrolling, or outline synchronization problems.

> Test quote 01: A predictable interface reduces the effort required to understand complex information.

```text
section_id = 01
record_id  = MD-1001
state      = active
checksum   = 00007919
```


## Note 02: Naming Conventions

**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Team 3  
**Priority:** Low

Choose file names that remain understandable outside the original folder. Prefer descriptive words, stable dates, and version identifiers. This numbered section is intentionally similar to the other sections, but the identifiers, status values, and examples vary. Repetition helps reveal whether a reader's outline remains usable when many headings have nearly identical names.

### Objectives

- Confirm that heading anchors remain unique.
- Check whether the outline shows the full heading text.
- Search for `Note 02` and verify that the correct section is selected.
- Collapse and expand this section, if folding is supported.

### Example Record

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record ID | MD-1002 |
| Revision | 3.2 |
| Category | Naming Conventions |
| Confidence | 72% |
| Review Cycle | 3 months |

### Observation

The rendering should remain consistent across the entire file. Heading size, paragraph spacing, table borders, inline-code styling, and list indentation should not drift between early and late sections. Long documents are especially useful for identifying memory leaks, delayed scrolling, or outline synchronization problems.

> Test quote 02: A predictable interface reduces the effort required to understand complex information.

```text
section_id = 02
record_id  = MD-1002
state      = active
checksum   = 00015838
```


## Note 03: Change Control

**Status:** Planned  
**Owner:** Team 4  
**Priority:** High

Record significant changes in a concise changelog. Include the date, author, reason, and expected effect of each revision. This numbered section is intentionally similar to the other sections, but the identifiers, status values, and examples vary. Repetition helps reveal whether a reader's outline remains usable when many headings have nearly identical names.

### Objectives

- Confirm that heading anchors remain unique.
- Check whether the outline shows the full heading text.
- Search for `Note 03` and verify that the correct section is selected.
- Collapse and expand this section, if folding is supported.

### Example Record

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record ID | MD-1003 |
| Revision | 4.3 |
| Category | Change Control |
| Confidence | 73% |
| Review Cycle | 4 months |

### Observation

The rendering should remain consistent across the entire file. Heading size, paragraph spacing, table borders, inline-code styling, and list indentation should not drift between early and late sections. Long documents are especially useful for identifying memory leaks, delayed scrolling, or outline synchronization problems.

> Test quote 03: A predictable interface reduces the effort required to understand complex information.

```text
section_id = 03
record_id  = MD-1003
state      = active
checksum   = 00023757
```


## Note 04: Review Process

**Status:** Complete  
**Owner:** Team 5  
**Priority:** Medium

Separate factual verification from stylistic editing. A document can be clear but incorrect, or correct but difficult to use. This numbered section is intentionally similar to the other sections, but the identifiers, status values, and examples vary. Repetition helps reveal whether a reader's outline remains usable when many headings have nearly identical names.

### Objectives

- Confirm that heading anchors remain unique.
- Check whether the outline shows the full heading text.
- Search for `Note 04` and verify that the correct section is selected.
- Collapse and expand this section, if folding is supported.

### Example Record

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record ID | MD-1004 |
| Revision | 5.4 |
| Category | Review Process |
| Confidence | 74% |
| Review Cycle | 5 months |

### Observation

The rendering should remain consistent across the entire file. Heading size, paragraph spacing, table borders, inline-code styling, and list indentation should not drift between early and late sections. Long documents are especially useful for identifying memory leaks, delayed scrolling, or outline synchronization problems.

> Test quote 04: A predictable interface reduces the effort required to understand complex information.

```text
section_id = 04
record_id  = MD-1004
state      = complete
checksum   = 00031676
```


## Note 05: Searchability

**Status:** In review  
**Owner:** Team 6  
**Priority:** Low

Use stable terminology for important concepts. Synonyms are natural, but inconsistent naming can make exact search less effective. This numbered section is intentionally similar to the other sections, but the identifiers, status values, and examples vary. Repetition helps reveal whether a reader's outline remains usable when many headings have nearly identical names.

### Objectives

- Confirm that heading anchors remain unique.
- Check whether the outline shows the full heading text.
- Search for `Note 05` and verify that the correct section is selected.
- Collapse and expand this section, if folding is supported.

### Example Record

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record ID | MD-1005 |
| Revision | 1.5 |
| Category | Searchability |
| Confidence | 75% |
| Review Cycle | 6 months |

### Observation

The rendering should remain consistent across the entire file. Heading size, paragraph spacing, table borders, inline-code styling, and list indentation should not drift between early and late sections. Long documents are especially useful for identifying memory leaks, delayed scrolling, or outline synchronization problems.

> Test quote 05: A predictable interface reduces the effort required to understand complex information.

```text
section_id = 05
record_id  = MD-1005
state      = active

## Note 06: Cross-References

**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Team 7  
**Priority:** High

Link related sections directly. Internal links reduce duplication and help readers move between procedures, explanations, and reference material. This numbered section is intentionally similar to the other sections, but the identifiers, status values, and examples vary. Repetition helps reveal whether a reader's outline remains usable when many headings have nearly identical names.

### Objectives

- Confirm that heading anchors remain unique.
- Check whether the outline shows the full heading text.
- Search for `Note 06` and verify that the correct section is selected.
- Collapse and expand this section, if folding is supported.

### Example Record

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record ID | MD-1006 |
| Revision | 2.6 |
| Category | Cross-References |
| Confidence | 76% |
| Review Cycle | 1 months |

### Observation

The rendering should remain consistent across the entire file. Heading size, paragraph spacing, table borders, inline-code styling, and list indentation should not drift between early and late sections. Long documents are especially useful for identifying memory leaks, delayed scrolling, or outline synchronization problems.

This numbered section is intentionally similar to the other sections, but the identifiers, status values, and examples vary. Repetition helps reveal whether a reader's outline remains usable when many headings have nearly identical names.

### Objectives

- Confirm that heading anchors remain unique.
- Check whether the outline shows the full heading text.
- Search for `Note 50` and verify that the correct section is selected.
- Collapse and expand this section, if folding is supported.

### Example Record

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record ID | MD-1050 |
| Revision | 1.0 |
| Category | Naming Conventions |
| Confidence | 91% |
| Review Cycle | 3 months |

### Observation

The rendering should remain consistent across the entire file. Heading size, paragraph spacing, table borders, inline-code styling, and list indentation should not drift between early and late sections. Long documents are especially useful for identifying memory leaks, delayed scrolling, or outline synchronization problems.
