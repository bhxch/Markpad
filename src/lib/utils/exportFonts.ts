/**
 * KaTeX web fonts for an exported HTML file.
 *
 * #382 decided not to inline any fonts into an export, and it was right at the
 * time: the export had no KaTeX output in it at all, so KaTeX's `@font-face`
 * rules travelled in the copied stylesheet as pure dead weight — rules whose
 * relative `url()`s 404 next to the exported file, and which the export CSP
 * (`font-src data:`) blocks anyway. Nothing referenced them, so nothing looked
 * wrong.
 *
 * Now that the export renders math, that reasoning inverts. Every `.katex`
 * subtree asks for `KaTeX_Main` first and falls back to
 * `Times New Roman, serif`, and KaTeX lays the formula out using *its own*
 * font metrics — glyph widths, the height of a fraction bar, where an accent
 * sits. Fall back and the layout stays but the glyphs no longer fit it, and
 * anything KaTeX draws from its dedicated fonts is simply not in Times:
 * stretchy delimiters (KaTeX_Size1–4), most AMS symbols, `\mathcal`,
 * `\mathfrak`, `\mathscr`. Those come out as tofu or as the wrong letter.
 *
 * So the fonts have to be embedded, and the only question is how many. All 20
 * faces are 296 KB raw / ~395 KB as base64 — paid by every export, including
 * the ones with no math. Instead this module works out which families the
 * rendered article actually references, embeds only those, and deletes the rest
 * of KaTeX's `@font-face` rules from the copied stylesheet. A document with no
 * math therefore gets *smaller* than before (the dead rules go too); a document
 * with ordinary algebra pays for KaTeX_Main and KaTeX_Math only.
 *
 * Granularity is the family, not the individual face. Picking the exact
 * weight/style would need the export to resolve the cascade (`\mathbf` sets
 * `font-weight` on top of a family, `<strong>` around math changes it again),
 * and getting that subtly wrong shows up as one italic variable silently
 * rendering in Times. "If a family is referenced at all, ship its faces" cannot
 * fail that way.
