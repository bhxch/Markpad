/**
 * What an already-open document opens AS — the preference behind #183.
 *
 * One choice rather than two switches. `isEditing` and `isSplit` are
 * independent flags on the tab, so a preference expressed as two booleans can
 * say "editor AND split", which is not a state the reader can be in: split view
 * wins the layout (`MarkdownViewer`'s pane flex reads `isSplit` first) and the
 * editor flag would only decide where closing the split lands. The question the
 * reader is actually answering has three answers, so it is stored as three.
 *
 * This does NOT cover a new empty document — `Ctrl+N` has its own preference
 * (`newFileDefaultMode`), because "what should an empty buffer open as" and
 * "what should a file I picked open as" are not the same question.

 * The stored preference, and what to do about the boolean it replaced.
 *
 * Until split view became a third answer this was `editor.startInEditor`, a
 * checkbox. An upgrade must not change what anybody's app does, so a machine
 * with no `editor.openFileMode` yet is asked the old question instead — `true`
 * meant "editor", and its `false`/absent meant "preview", which is the default
 * here. The old key is left where it is rather than migrated away: it costs
 * nothing, and a user who rolls back to the previous version finds their
 * setting still there.
 *
 * Read once. The first write of the new key ends the fallback, so a reader who
 * later picks "preview" does not get "editor" back on the next launch.
