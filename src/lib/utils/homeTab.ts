 * The home screen is not a document, but it lives in a tab — and a tab
 * identifies itself by `path`. So the home tab carries a sentinel string where
 * every other tab carries a filesystem path.
 *
 * The sentinel is spelled here and nowhere else. It used to be spelled at ten
 * separate comparison sites, and the one place that mattered most — the render
 * gate in MarkdownViewer.svelte — was not among them: it recognised the home
 * tab as `path === '' && title === 'Recents'`, which described the home tab as
 * it was first written and nothing since (#392). A literal that only some of
 * its readers know about is a literal that can fall out of step in silence, so
 * `singleImplementationConvention.test.ts` pins the string to this file.
 *
 * A tab kind is not really a path, and nothing stops a document from being
 * opened at a relative path spelled exactly `HOME`. Neither is fixed here, but
 * both are now a single edit rather than a search-and-replace.
