/*
 * Vim's scroll-cursor family — `zz`, `zt`, `zb`, `z.`, `z-`, `z<CR>` — does
 * nothing in monaco-vim 0.4.4 (#104, #393). Two separate defects, both here.
 *
 * 1. THE SCROLL NEVER HAPPENS. All six keys route to one action:
 *
 *        scrollToCursor: function (cm, actionArgs) {
 *          var charCoords = cm.charCoords(new Pos(lineNum, 0), "local");
 *          var y = charCoords.top;
 *          var lineHeight = charCoords.bottom - y;
 *          switch (actionArgs.position) { … }   // y becomes a pixel offset
 *          cm.moveCurrentLineTo(y);
 *        }
 *
 *    while the adapter it hands that number to is:
 *
 *        moveCurrentLineTo(viewPosition) {
 *          switch (viewPosition) {
 *            case "top":    editor.revealRangeAtTop(range); return;
 *            case "center": editor.revealRangeInCenter(range); return;
 *            case "bottom": editor._revealRange?.(range, Bottom); return;
 *          }
 *        }
 *
 *    No default branch, so a number matches nothing and the call silently
 *    returns. The arithmetic is doubly meaningless in this adapter: its
 *    `charCoords` returns `{ top: pos.line, left: pos.ch }` — line numbers, not
 *    pixels, and with no `bottom` key at all, so `lineHeight` is `NaN` and `y`
 *    is `NaN` for `center` and `bottom`.
 *
 *    The fix hands `moveCurrentLineTo` one of the three strings its switch is
 *    written for and drops the pixel arithmetic, which nothing in this adapter
 *    could have used.
 *
 * 2. `zb` AND `z-` ARE SWAPPED. Vim (`:help scroll-cursor`) pairs each position
 *    with a letter form that keeps the cursor column and a punctuation form that
 *    moves it to the first non-blank:
 *
 *        zt / z<CR>   top       zz / z.   center      zb / z-   bottom
 *              ^ first non-blank      ^                    ^
 *
 *    0.4.4 gets top and center right and has bottom backwards: its `z-` keeps
 *    the column and its `zb` carries `motion: "moveToFirstNonWhiteSpaceCharacter"`.
 *    Nobody could see it while defect 1 made the whole family dead — fixing the
 *    scroll is what would have made a wrong cursor visible, so both go together.
 *
 * WHY NOT AN UPGRADE: 0.4.4 is the latest release (2025-11-22) and upstream
 * master has only dependency bumps since; `moveCurrentLineTo` is unchanged
 * there. WHY NOT A PATCH: `Vim.defineAction` and `Vim.mapCommand` are the
 * package's own extension points, so nothing here touches a dependency's file.
 *
 * DEGRADING: every step is guarded and the whole thing is a no-op if the API is
 * not what this file expects, so an upgrade that renames or removes it costs a
 * silent return, not a crash on entering Vim mode.
 * `scripts/vimScrollCommands.test.ts` drives the six keys through the real
 * package and fails when upstream's behaviour changes underneath.
