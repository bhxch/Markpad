 * The link "Copy Reference" puts on the clipboard, in the spelling the

 * Markpad understands two:
 *
 *     [[note#Setup]]              Obsidian's, rewritten before the parse
 *     [Setup](note.md#setup)      CommonMark's, which every reader resolves
 *
 * It used to always write the first. Which is right depends on the reader, not
 * on the app: someone whose vault is full of `[[…]]` wants another one, and
 * someone writing documents for GitHub wants a link that survives leaving this
 * app. Neither answer is right for both, and the document itself is the one
 * piece of evidence available — a person's habit is already written down in
 * the file they are working in.
 *
 * So the style is inferred, and the inference has a floor: where the document
 * says nothing, or says both, the answer is what this menu has always
 * produced. It can be better than the old behaviour and never worse.
 *
 * The caveat worth knowing: a reference is usually pasted into a DIFFERENT
 * document, so following this one is a guess about that one. In practice a
 * person writes one way throughout, which is what makes the guess worth
 * making — but it is a guess.
