/**
 * "Copy Reference" writes the spelling the document is already written in.
 *
 * Markpad understands two ways to link a heading — `[[note#Setup]]`, which it
 * rewrites before the parse, and `[Setup](note.md#setup)`, which every reader
 * resolves — and this menu always produced the first. Which one is right
 * depends on the person, not on the app: a vault full of `[[…]]` wants
 * another one; a document written for GitHub wants a link that survives
 * leaving Markpad.
 *
 * The document is the evidence, because a person's habit is already written
 * down in the file they are working in. The inference has a floor: says
 * nothing, or says both, and the answer is what the menu always produced. So
 * it can be better than the old behaviour and never worse — which is the only
 * reason inferring is defensible here at all.
 *
 * Known and accepted: a reference is usually pasted into a DIFFERENT document,
 * so following this one is a guess about that one.
